/*
Creating a component

The most simple component has a `render` method that returns some
JSX. `props` are attributes that are passed into the component 
when you instantiate it. 

One caveat is that `render` must return a single parent element;
you can't return multiple adjacent JSX tags but must wrap them
in one parent element.

var HelloMessage = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return <h1>Hello {this.props.message}!</h1>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(<HelloMessage message="World" />, document.getElementById('root'));
