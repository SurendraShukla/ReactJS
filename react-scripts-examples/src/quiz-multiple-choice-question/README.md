A user is taken through a series of multiple choice questions and being assessed based on the options chosen.
* Create a JSON structure to iterate through the questions. Set a score for each options (1, 2, 3 etc)
* User can navigate back and forth and can change their choices (see visuals within folder screenshots)
* There is only single route for all questions (/assessment)
* On the last page display final score (no visuals provided)

Use create-react-app to boilerplate app code (npm install -g create-react-app)
https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

It uses 
* Question text `https://www.lipsum.com/`
* React Router `https://medium.com/@pshrmn/a-simple-react-router-v4-tutorial-7f23ff27adf`
